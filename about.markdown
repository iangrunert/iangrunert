Currently at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) (F1 '23), focusing on improving the 
Windows port for WebKit. May also do some Rust things.

Previously a Principal Engineer / Architect at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/),
primarily worked on Trello, Confluence and Jira. Also wrote some code in Bitbucket Server + Cloud, 
HipChat, JIRA Capture, and probably some others I'm forgetting.

I've dabbled in some research on 
[genetic programming](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2001576.2001768), and worked at 
[Rising Sun Pictures](https://www.rsp.com.au/) building tools for VFX artists working on Harry 
Potter.
