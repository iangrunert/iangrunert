Static site generators, and choosing the "right" one is a real rabbit hole. There's an overwhelming 
set of options, each have upsides and downsides, and there is always a temptation to roll-your-own 
bespoke solution.

It helps if you come in with some requirements, mine personally are:

* Minimal setup
* RSS Feed
* Authoring posts in markdown

... and that's about it. Trying to spend as little time on setting up the blog, so I can spend more 
time writing. To that end, I chose Jekyll as it requires no additional setup to deploy to Github 
Pages. I doubt I'll write enough posts that the build time will be annoying.

There's an inverse correlation - blogs with higher number of posts have fewer posts about elaborate blog setups. At the top-left, wordpress setup from 2004. At the bottom-right, authors of custom static site generators.](https://rakhim.org/images/honestly-undefined/blogging.jpg)](https://rakhim.org/honestly-undefined/19/)
